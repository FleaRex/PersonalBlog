## Information gathering

When you're in first, looking forward doesn't give you anywhere near enough information. You get to see the track ahead and any obstacles that have been left by other players. You don't get to see any of the other players.

You do have three options for keeping tabs on the other players:
1) The minimap
2) Screen-watching
3) Looking behind you

**The minimap:** Super easy to use. Gives you great information on when the next blue shell is and your lead on the next player.

**Screen-watching:** Unless you're playing online, your biggest competition will be on the screen right next to you. You want to watch the player in second, particularly checking for the items that they have. If they don't have any red shells, then you are free to play more aggressively. You can throw items backwards or use them up to get new items!

**Looking behind you:** A bit trickier than the other two options. You lose all vision forward. What you get in return is good information about any incoming projectiles. Nothing hurts more than being hit by a green shell. Note this is only useful if the other players are close enough behind you to see them.
