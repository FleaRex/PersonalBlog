  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Welcome to the blog! I hope you've been enjoying youself. I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Made Tech, where I help deliver public sector projects. I love</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Managing teams and developers</li>
    <li>Developing software that demonstrably helps users and creates value</li>
    <li>Safely and gracefully changing systems with live users</li>
    <li>DevOps</li>
  </ul>

  In September 2022, I gave my first conference talk, _How to Get Nothing Done_, at DevOpsDays London.

  <div class="about-me--divider"></div>

  <p>I'm a big believer in practice and trying new things. Practicing something relevant with work that you're going to throw away gives you the opportunity to truly focus on learning without worrying about outputs or failure. Trying something new that's completely irrelevant is tremendously fun, rewarding, and often not as irrelevant as you think.</p>

  <p>With that in mind, and to encourage me to try more new things, I'm listing things I've tried here. These range from the languages that I'm most confident in to frameworks I've used once.</p>

  <p>Disclaimer: These bars are not representative of much.</p>

  <table class="about-me--tried">
    {% assign sorted = site.data.tried | sort: 'confidence' | reverse %}
    {% for item in sorted %}
      <tr>
        <td class="about-me--tried--name">
          {% if item.blog_post %}
            <a href="{{ item.blog_post }}">
          {% endif %}
            {{ item.name }}
          {% if item.blog_post %}
            </a>
          {% endif %}
          {% if item.tags %}
            {% for tag in item.tags %}
              <span class="tag__{{ tag }}">{{ tag }}</span>
            {% endfor %}
          {% endif %}
        </td>
        <td class="about-me--tried--confidence__{{ item.confidence }}"></td>
      </tr>
    {% endfor %}
