title: Get To Five
---

You have to make decisions every day. We tend to get caught up in do I want to do this or that. Should we use X or Y. I use a very simple framework for making decisions. Just get to five.

Our heads love seeing choices as a dichotomy, blinding us to the other possibilities. To escape this, all you have to do is come up with five options. You've already got two of them. The third tends to be somewhere in between the first two. The fourth and fifth are a real struggle to get to and really force you to think of options. This is where the really interesting ideas can come from. You also feel like you've properly explored all the options, so you can make your choice quicker.
