excerpt: I've been reading at John Cutler's blog and Twitter for about a year. He makes me inspired to want to change things. To find areas that aren't going well and help them improve. Recently he published "So You Want to Fix Something?" a blog post that reads like a Twitter thread (because it is). I wish he had published it sooner.

I've been reading at John Cutler's [blog](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish) for about a year. He makes me inspired to want to change things. To find areas that aren't going well and help them improve. Recently he published ["So You Want to Fix Something?"](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/so-you-want-to-fix-something-b7182bda31eb) a blog post that reads like a Twitter thread ([because it is](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1163337618676781056)). I wish he had published it sooner.

Veering off on a tangent for the briefest of moments, we've just had [DevOps Days London 2019](https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-london). One of the best parts of this conference is the [Open Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) sessions that happen in the afternoons. It's free time to discuss the issues that are most important to us. The most interesting topic to me was _DevOps in a non-Dev world_, how do you bring the introduction of DevOps ideas to a company who's primary function isn't producing software.

My suggestion is to make it as safe as possible for whoever will need to approve your change. Try to:
1\. Make whatever you want to change as small as possible. Make it inarguably not harmful.
2\. Phrase it as a trial. It's a lot easier to approve a trial than a new change.
3\. If you are hoping to get some business benefit, then get backing from the business.
4\. Measure what you are hoping to change (cycle time, employee happiness, defects) and show that you have improved it

These are things that I have found useful, combined with the discussion. Hopefully it will allow you to start bringing in changes more quickly.
