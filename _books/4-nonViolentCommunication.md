I started reading this book when I found myself getting frustrated in meetings. The more I cared the less people listened. This book helped me a lot in work and out. Key takeaways:

-   The central idea is the Observation-Feeling-Need-Request cycle, for creating empathy.
-   Remove judgements from your observations. Rosenburg points out a lot of judgements that you wouldn't think about.
-   Remove thoughts from your feelings. He points out "I feel that" is really a thought and not a feeling at all.
