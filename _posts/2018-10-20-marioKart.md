So you've been playing Mario Kart for a while and it's going well! You can beat the computers pretty much every time and you find yourself getting into first and then losing it! This is a really frustrating stage to be at. Here are a few tips that I've come across to get you out of that zone and holding onto first.

## Don't hold your item behind you

Unless the kart behind you is *very* close, you don't need to hold an item behind you for protection all the time. The game gives you enough warning to get the item out.

//EXAMPLE OF THE WARNING//

Why would you want to do this? When you're in first, you get a really limited supply of defensive items (i.e. items that protect you from red shells) so you need to use them all as well as possible. If you get hit by a blue shell or a bob-omb you'll be hit *and* it will destroy the item.

## Hold a coin

Hopefully by now you know by now that the further back you are, the better your items get. This means that, when you are in first, a lot of your items are coins. (Sometimes you get a coin in second!)

In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe we can deal with this: You've got two item slots and they can't both be coins! Just don't use a coin if it's in your first item slot and your second item slot is free. That way you're guaranteed to get a defensive item.

## Keep holding the coin

So now your first item is a coin and your second item is a defensive item.

//EXAMPLE OF THIS SITUATION//

Now don't use the coin (unless you need the coins that is)! This protects you from a ghost from stealing your defensive item! **AND** as a bonus you know whoever had the ghost has gotten a coin instead of something better.

## Information gathering

When you're in first, looking forward doesn't give you anywhere near enough information. You get to see the track ahead and any obstacles that have been left by other players. You don't get to see any of the other players.

You do have three options for keeping tabs on the other players:
1) The minimap
2) Screen-watching
3) Looking behind you

**The minimap:** Super easy to use. Gives you great information on when the next blue shell is and your lead on the next player.

**Screen-watching:** Unless you're playing online, your biggest competition will be on the screen right next to you. You want to watch the player in second, particularly checking for the items that they have. If they don't have any red shells, then you are free to play more aggressively. You can throw items backwards or use them up to get new items!

**Looking behind you:** A bit trickier than the other two options. You lose all vision forward. What you get in return is good information about any incoming projectiles. Nothing hurts more than being hit by a green shell. Note this is only useful if the other players are close enough behind you to see them.

## Know the map

## Most importantly

If someone good is doing something that seems illogical, ask them why they're doing it. It could change everything!
