title: 'An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management'
author: Will Larson

_An Elegant Puzzle_ is a great book on engineering management. It covered a load of really great stuff. I would be lying if I tried to summarise it down to three bullet points. Honestly, in looking for some examples of good bits I've decided I need to reread it and make thorough notes. Covers topics like interviewing, reorganisations and delegating. I feel like I've undersold it.

Another interesting and excellent read (with a lot of crossover) is _The Manager's Path_ by Camille Fournier.
