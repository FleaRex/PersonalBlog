author: Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, George Spafford

The book without which the rest of this list would be empty. It's a good read and I've recommended it to a lot of people. Key takeaways:

-   It's very easy for someone to become a bottleneck, even when they have good intentions.
-   Watch for the different types of work (Business Projects, Operations Projects, Changes, Unplanned Work).
-   Consider the whole value stream and optimise for flow and low work in progress.

##### Honourable Mentions:

-   _The Unicorn Project_ is an excellent book but I find the writing a little bit worse.
-   _The DevOps Handbook_ is also an excellent book, but a little long to recommend.
