title: Major Blog Update
---

I started a new job in February and suddenly I'm doing some frontend development (but in a strange mix I'm also doing some machine learning). It's been a real change and I've learned a lot about CSS, Sass and Vue. To celebrate this I've done a major refresh on the blog.

<div style="width: 40%;">{% picture The diff on the redesign |/assets/images/redesigndiff.png %}</div>

In a message to my former self, here are the things that were super crucial to get my head around:

-   The `position` property (particularly the `relative` and `absolute` values)
-   Properly using `padding` and `margin` instead of overly relying on `top`/`down`/`left`/`right`
-   `display: flex` ([CSS Tricks has amazing content on this](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/))
-   Talking to parent components with `emit` in Vue  

Another thing that helped a lot was watching [@chrisoncode](https://twitter.com/chrisoncode) on twitch. The home page buttons are greatly inspired by one his streams.
