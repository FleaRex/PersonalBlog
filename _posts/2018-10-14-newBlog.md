title: New Blog Infrastructure
---

Hi all! This is a place where I'm tracking my own personal investigations and experimentations. Starting with this website. The eventual plan is for this to become a place with real advice for real people. For now I can look back on this as a reference and reminder for the things I've done and to cringe at the things I've said.

## Infrastructure

The blog is written in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with continuous deployment from [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) to an [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket which hosts the website. I've made a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/FleaRex/PersonalBlog/tree/v1.0.0) which has the website just as all of this infrastructure was first created.

The rest of this blog post will be going through why I chose these platforms and which tutorials and troubleshooting I had to do to get up and running.

## S3 Hosting

I chose to host the website on S3 for a few reasons:
1. I'm looking to get more involved with the AWS ecosystem.
2. I have some knowledge of AWS (the [AWS Essentials course on Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com/amazon-web-services/training/course/name/aws-essentials)).
3. I assumed it would be really simple to get started. It was.

I used [this guide supplied by AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html). It was really easy to follow and I only had two sticking points:
1. At step 2.5, "Test Your Endpoint and Redirect", I didn't know what it meant by the endpoint. It is found in the properties of the bucket and then clicking on the "Static website hosting" box.

2. At step 4, "Testing" I didn't see the note saying that changes may take time to take effect. This left me wondering why my site wasn't there. Eventually it appeared.

## Jekyll Blogging

I knew that I wanted to have a source controlled website, for the source control itself and so that I could set it up with a CI/CD system.

I didn't want to set up and manage a database or make new posts via an interface.

Some bonuses that came along with Jekyll:
- Blogging in markdown.
- Really nice systems for repeated layouts and repeatedly used elements.
- A build step that was interesting to work into the CI/CD.
- `jekyll serve` for locally hosting the site automatically builds changes.

In the end I worked through [Jekyll's Step by Step Tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) which was an absolute dream. The only problem I had is that you have to restart `jekyll serve` every time you change the `_config.yml` file.

## Travis Deployment

Again, Travis was in the sweet spot of something that I want to experiment with but have some knowledge of. To set it up I used two resources:
- [Travis S3 Deployment](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/s3/)
- [Jekyll Travis CI](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/travis-ci/)

Deploying to S3 was remarkably easy, possibly due to the experience I already had. One thing that I didn't know (but in retrospect it's pretty important!) was that Travis won't complete deploy steps on pull request builds. I had initially turned of "Build pushed branches" to limit the number of builds I was running.

I also got the error message "No Rakefile found" on some of my earliest builds as I hadn't specified a language, so Travis defaulted to ruby, but there was no ruby present. In the end the "GitHub and Travis CI" section of [this blog by Michal Frystacky](https://medium.com/@michal.frystacky/static-site-github-to-s3-770953a90f67) provided me what I needed.

Building and testing Jekyll had another issue. I got the error `The command "eval bundle install --jobs=3 --retry=3 --deployment --path=${BUNDLE_PATH:-vendor/bundle} " failed`. On some further research I found [an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/6833) which told me that I couldn't commit my `Gemfile.lock`. This was pretty sad, but for the sake of an easy life right now I settled for it. Until I look into it further, the only other solution I could see is doing work on this blog in a VM.

## Next Steps

Potential next steps include:
- Infrastructure as Code!
- Integrating some of my previous projects (more info on some of these are to come)
- New projects! We all love new projects!
