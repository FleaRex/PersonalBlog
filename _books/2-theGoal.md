Another great book about actually causing improvements. Even more focused on lowering work in progress than The Phoenix Project. Key takeaways:

-   There's a biggest constraint in the system and any improvements you make away from the constraint will not actually cause any benefit.
-   Limit your work in progress. There's no point in keeping people busy if that means they aren't able to work on what is important.
-   You must focus on the system as a whole to make improvements.
