So you've been playing Mario Kart for a while and it's going well! You can beat the computers pretty much every time and you find yourself getting into first and then losing it! This is a really frustrating stage to be at. Here are a few tips that I've come across to get you out of that zone and holding onto first. For this blog I'll be focusing on defensive item management.

## Don't hold your item behind you

Unless the kart behind you is *very* close, you don't need to hold an item behind you for protection all the time. The game gives you enough warning to get the item out.

//EXAMPLE OF THE WARNING//

Why would you want to do this? When you're in first, you get a really limited supply of defensive items (i.e. items that protect you from red shells) so you need to use them all as well as possible. If you get hit by a blue shell or a bob-omb you'll be hit *and* it will destroy the item.

## Hold a coin

Hopefully by now you know by now that the further back you are, the better your items get. This means that, when you are in first, a lot of your items are coins. (Sometimes you get a coin in second!)

In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe we can deal with this: You've got two item slots and they can't both be coins! Just don't use a coin if it's in your first item slot and your second item slot is free. That way you're guaranteed to get a defensive item.

## Keep holding the coin

So now your first item is a coin and your second item is a defensive item.

//EXAMPLE OF THIS SITUATION//

Now don't use the coin (unless you need the coins that is)! This protects you from a ghost from stealing your defensive item! **AND** as a bonus you know whoever had the ghost has gotten a coin instead of something better.
